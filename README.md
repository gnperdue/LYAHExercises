These exercises are meant to be solved after reading each appropriate Chapter of the 
excellent ``Learn You a Haskell.'' The goal is to have about thirty problems per chapter, 
although some chapters will have less, and perhaps some will have more. Most of the 
problems should be fairly easy, but a handful should be hard and another handful 
should ideally be quite challenging (but, ideally, challenging to program and not
challenging because they involve difficult math, etc.).
