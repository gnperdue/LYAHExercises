Problem 5-1
-----------
Implement a function that finds the length of a list using recursion and pattern matching.

Problem 5-2
-----------
Implement a function that takes a list of list of objects and ``flattens'' them into 
one list of objects.

Problem 5-3
-----------
Implement a function with this type signature using recursion and pattern matching:
`f :: [(a,b)] -> [a]`. What does the type signature tell you about all the possible
things this function might do?
