Problem 3-1
-----------

If you didn't already, try to write type signatures for all the exercises from Chapter 02.
Note, you should honestly try to write the signature at least once before ``cheating''
and loading the function into GHCi and using the `:t` command. In general, you should 
feel free to use `:t` frequently - it is a great way to learn the type system - but 
it is always a good idea to try at least once on your own first.

Problem 3-2
-----------
Write two factorial functions - one exactly like the example in the text, of type 
`Integer -> Integer` and another one of type `Int -> Int`. (Give them different 
names if you put them in the same file.) Evaluate both functions for the argument 
``50'' and compare the results.

Problem 3-3
-----------
Write a function that computes the probability mass function for the Poisson distribution.
It should take a Double and an Integer and return a Double.

Problem 3-4
-----------
Re-write the function from problem 3-3, but now use type variables. The `poisson` function
should take a `Floating a` and an `Integral b` and return a `Floating a`. Evaluate
the following expressions:

* `:t poisson 1.0 0`
* `:t poisson (1.0::Float) (0::Int)`
* `:t poisson (1.0::Double) (0::Integer)`
