Problem 6-1
-----------
Write a higher order function that takes an Integer and divides it by 10 using point free
style.

Problem 6-2
-----------
Write a function that takes a function with type `Double -> Double` and a list of
+Doubles+ and maps the function over the list. Test your result with a few functions
like `f x = 2 x` and `g x = x * x`. Try passing the functions in as lambdas.

Problem 6-3
-----------
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and a binary comparison function and uses 
recursion to apply the function across list. Test your function with `max` and `min` and 
make sure it behaves correctly.

Problem 6-4
-----------
Re-implement the function from problem 6-3 with a right-fold.

Problem 6-5
-----------
Write a program that computes the elements of Pascal's triangle using recursion. The 
function should take an Integral argument and produce the row of Pascal's Triangle 
corresponding to that row. So, the output should look like:

  Prelude> :l problem0605.hs 
  [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( problem0605.hs, interpreted )
  Ok, modules loaded: Main.
  *Main> pascal 1
  [1]
  *Main> pascal 2
  [1,1]
  *Main> pascal 3
  [1,2,1]
  *Main> pascal 4
  [1,3,3,1]
  *Main> pascal 5
  [1,4,6,4,1]
