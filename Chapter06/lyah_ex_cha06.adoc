Problem 6-1
-----------
Write a higher order function that takes an Integer and divides it by 10 using point free
style.

Problem 6-2
-----------
Write a function that takes a function with type `Double -> Double` and a list of
+Doubles+ and maps the function over the list. Test your result with a few functions
like `f x = 2 x` and `g x = x * x`. Try passing the functions in as lambdas.

Problem 6-3
-----------
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and a binary comparison function and uses 
recursion to apply the function across list. Test your function with `max` and `min` and 
make sure it behaves correctly.

Problem 6-4
-----------
Re-implement the function from problem 6-3 with a right-fold.
