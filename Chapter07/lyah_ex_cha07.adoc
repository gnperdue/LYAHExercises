Problem 7-1
-----------

Compose a script in wich you import Data.List, Data.Map.Strict, Data.Set, and
Data.Foldable.

Problem 7-2
-----------

Compose a script like you wrote for problem 7-1, but do qualified imports.

Problem 7-3
-----------

Compose another script where you import the same libraries as in problems 7-1 
and 7-2, but this time import only one function from each module. Look at 
http://hackage.haskell.org/ for some example functions.

Problem 7-4
-----------

Compose yet another script importing the same modules as in the previous problems, 
but this time hide a function for each module. Does it make sense to ``combine'' this 
problem with the previous problem (i.e., import a specific set of functions but also
hide some functions)?
